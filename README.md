Social Media Sentiment Analysis System

Project Overview

This project aims to develop an end-to-end sentiment analysis system that extracts insights from social media platforms and online reviews. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and data visualization, the system will analyze public sentiment towards brands, products, or topics in real-time or through historical data. The insights generated will help businesses enhance brand reputation management, customer engagement, and strategic decision-making.
